> Avoid if(err) return bla bla bla.

```
Some say the definition of insanity is to repeat the same thing over and over again
for no reason...
```

## Without err-handler
````javascript
app.get('/', function(req, res, next){
  Resource.get(function(err, resource){
    if(err)return next(err);
    res.json(resource);
  });
});
````

## With err-handler
````javascript
app.get('/', function(req, res, next){
  Resource.get(errHandler(next, function(err, resource){
    res.json(resource);
  });
});
````

_Let's avoid lines of code!_

## The gist

* `err-handler` takes 2 functions (`handler, cb`) and returns a function.
* If the returned function is passed an error, `err-handler` calls `handler` with
said error (you don't have to worry about handling it in your callback).
* If the handler returns any value not equal to `undefined`, `err-handler` calls `cb`
as if nothing happened.  This is useful for logging handlers.
* If the returned function receieves no error, then `cb` is called normally and
`handler` is never called.
